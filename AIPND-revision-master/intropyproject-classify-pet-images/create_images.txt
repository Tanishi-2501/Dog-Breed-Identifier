Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) classified the breed of 'dog in Dog_01.jpg' as "golden retriever".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  No, all three model architectures classified Dog_02.jpg differently:

AlexNet: beagle
ResNet: beagle
VGG: beagle

All three model architectures incorrectly classified Dog_02.jpg as beagle instead of labrador retriever.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:  The provided results do not include classifications for Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg, so this information is unavailable.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Based on the results, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) performed equally well on the given images, correctly classifying Dog_01.jpg and incorrectly classifying Dog_02.jpg. However, considering general performance and strengths, ResNet is often the best choice for image classification tasks due to the following reasons:

Depth and Residual Connections: ResNet's deeper network and residual connections help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, leading to better feature extraction and overall accuracy.
Performance on Complex Datasets: ResNet has consistently shown superior performance on complex and diverse image datasets, making it a robust choice for image classification.
Therefore, I would recommend ResNet as the best model architecture to train for your pet image classification task. It is expected to yield better results on a larger and more varied dataset, and its architectural advantages make it a strong candidate for achieving high classification accuracy . Therefore according to my experience,I consider ResNet.
